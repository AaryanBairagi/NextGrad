NextGrad 🎓
Predict your chance of admission with ML | DSBDA Mini Project 2025

🚀 About the Project
NextGrad is a machine learning-based web application that predicts the probability (%) of a student's admission into a graduate school, based on various academic and research parameters.
This project was developed as part of the Data Science and Business Data Analytics (DSBDA) course mini-project.

📈 Features
*Predicts chance of admission based on user inputs:
1. GRE Score
2. TOEFL Score
3. University Rating
4. SOP Strength
5. LOR Strength
6. CGPA
7. Research Experience
*Random Forest model used for accurate predictions
*Interactive and responsive frontend
*Displays visual graph of the result (Chart.js 📊)

🛠️ Tech Stack
-Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Chart.js, Toastify)
-Backend: Python (Flask Framework)
-Machine Learning Model: Random Forest Regressor
-Libraries: pandas, scikit-learn, numpy, joblib
-Deployment: Localhost

🧠 How It Works
1. User enters their academic profile in the form.
2. The frontend sends a POST request to the Flask backend.
3. The backend uses the trained Random Forest model to predict the admission chance.
4. The result is displayed as a percentage with a beautiful progress graph.

📝 Dataset
The dataset used is based on Graduate Admissions data available publicly on Kaggle:
Graduate Admission Dataset – Kaggle
Features include GRE, TOEFL, SOP, LOR, CGPA, University Rating, and Research Experience.
